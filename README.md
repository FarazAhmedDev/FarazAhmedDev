# Hi, I’m Faraz Ahmed 👋

QA Automation Engineer focused on end-to-end mobile testing with Appium, TestNG, and cloud device labs. I turn flaky manual flows into reliable pipelines, complete with solid reporting and actionable logs.

- 🔁 **Current focus:** Stabilising Motiv’s Android coach signup, change password, and chat flows with Appium + Gmail OTP automation.
- 🚀 **Playbook:** fast environment bootstraps (`adb`, scripts, shell tooling) + resilient helpers (`safeClick`, `forceTypeText`, retry wrappers).
- 📍 Based in Pakistan — open to remote collaboration.

## What I Work With

| Area | Tools & Tech |
| ---- | ------------ |
| Mobile automation | Appium, UiAutomator2, Espresso, Android Debug Bridge |
| Test orchestration | TestNG, Maven, GitHub Actions, Jenkins |
| Scripting & tooling | Bash, Python, Node.js, Maestro, Postman |
| Monitoring & logs | Allure, custom log pipelines, device video capture |

## Featured Projects

- [MotivAutomation](https://github.com/FarazAhmedDev/MotivAutomation) – complete Android coach signup, profile, change-password & chat regression suite with Gmail OTP ingestion and fallback tactics for flaky UI.
- Maestro Flow Library – Stress, chaos, and exploratory flows for Motiv (dual-device orchestration + screenshots for every screen).
- AppiumJava Legacy Suite – Historical scripts kept for reference; useful for quick reproductions and element inspection.

## Recent Wins

- Cut signup flow flakiness by 60% with layered locator strategies and force-tap fallbacks captured in structured logs.
- Automated OTP retrieval via Gmail + layout-agnostic regex, saving manual email lookups for every run.
- Simplified CI triggers so QA and developers can kick off targeted flows (`run_coach.sh`, `run_tests.sh`) with environment hygiene baked in.
